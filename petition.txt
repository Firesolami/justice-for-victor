Subject: Appeal for Reconsideration of Victor Ibironke's Disqualification for BUCC VP Academics

This letter is to appeal the decision to disqualify Victor Ibironke for the position of BUCC Vice President Academics. The reason for the disqualification as stated in the results was that he was campaigning during the elections. 

We can provide ample proof that every member of his team stood against any form of campaign during elections as we believe in following due process and upholding the law that has kept BUCC's electoral practices free and fair over the years.

Given the substantial margin of 248 votes, with Victor securing over 640 votes, it is highly improbable that this significant level of support was solely influenced by any form of campaign during the few hours in which the voting took place. This significant vote difference highlights the strong support he received from the voters.

We acknowledge that an unintentional oversight regarding the rules of campaign may have occurred due to a lack of complete clarity on its interpretation but immediate action was taken when this oversight was pointed out.

Considering the significant student support demonstrated by the election results and our commitment to a fair democratic process, we respectfully request a re-run for the position of BUCC Vice President Academics. This would allow the student body to exercise their will based on a clear understanding of the electoral rules by all candidates.

Thank you again for the opportunity to appeal this disqualification decision and we know that without a doubt, ignorance would not repeat itself. 

We hope to hear from you soon with a favourable response.
